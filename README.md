**1. Question: Name some important tab components of Unity 3D.**

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- Hierarchy: The hierarchy displays every GameObject in a list.
- Game view: The game view option lets developers view the game and make changes to it as they play in real time.
- Scene view: The scene view is a 3D preview of the open scene. Here, developers can add and manage GameObjects.
- Project window: The project window is ideal for complex games. Game developers can use the project window to find game assets in a directory for all models, scripts, and prefabs.
- Toolbar: The toolbar contains various tools for the game and scene windows.

**2. Question: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? List principles of Object-Oriented Programming.**

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm, or classification, that organizes a group of data attributes with functions or methods into a unit, known as an object.

- There are 4 principles of OOP:
  - **Encapsulation** means to enclose data by containing it within an object. In OOP, encapsulation forms a barrier around data to protect it from the rest of the code. You can perform encapsulation by binding the data and its functions into a class. This action conceals the private details of a class and only exposes the functionality essential for interfacing with it. When a class doesn't allow direct access to its private data, it's well-encapsulated.
  - **Abstraction** refers to using simplified classes, rather than complex implementation code, to access objects. Often, it's easier to design a program when you can separate the interface of a class from its implementation. In OOP, you can abstract the implementation details of a class and present a clean, easy-to-use interface through the class member functions. Abstraction helps isolate the impact of changes made to the code so if an error occurs, the change only affects the implementation details of a class and not the outside code.
  - Most object-oriented languages support **Inheritance**, which means a new class automatically inhabits the same properties and functionalities as its parent class. Inheritance allows you to organize classes into hierarchies, where a class might have one or more parent or child classes. If a class has a parent class, it means the class has inherited the properties of the parent. The child class can also modify or extend the behavior of its parent class. Inheritance allows you to reuse code without redefining the functions of a child class.
  - **Polymorphism** refers to creating objects with shared behaviors. In OOP, polymorphism allows for the uniform treatment of classes in a hierarchy. When you write code for objects at the root of the hierarchy, any objects created by a child class within the hierarchy have the same functions. Depending on the type of object, it may execute different behaviors.
